/* 
Working with conditionals means that we will 
be using booleans, true or false values. 
In JavaScript, there are operators that work with 
boolean values known as logical operators. 
We can use logical operators to add more 
sophisticated logic to our conditionals. 

There are three logical operators:

the and operator (&&)
- When we use the && operator, we are checking that two things are true

the or operator (||)
- If we only care about either condition being true, we can use the || operator

the not operator, otherwise known as the bang operator (!)
- The ! not operator reverses, or negates, the value of a boolean
