/* An else statement must be paired with an if statement, 
and together they are referred to as an if...else statement.

In the example above, the else statement:

Uses the else keyword following the code block of an if statement.

Has a code block that is wrapped by a set of curly braces {}.

The code inside the else statement code 
block will execute when the if statementâ€™s condition evaluates to false.

if...else statements allow us to automate solutions to yes-or-no questions, also known as binary decisions.
