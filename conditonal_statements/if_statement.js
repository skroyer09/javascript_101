/* Notice in the example above, we have an if statement. 
The if statement is composed of:

The if keyword followed by a set of 
parentheses () which is followed by a 
code block, or block statement, indicated 
by a set of curly braces {}.

Inside the parentheses (), a condition is 
provided that evaluates to true or false.

If the condition evaluates to true, 
the code inside the curly braces {} runs, or executes.

If the condition evaluates to false, the block wonâ€™t execute.
